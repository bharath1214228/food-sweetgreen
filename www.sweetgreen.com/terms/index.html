Dispute Resolution</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em> <em><strong>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“ </strong></em><strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong> <em><strong>”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate most disputes with Sweetgreen and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</strong></em></p><p>16.1 <u><strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong></u> You agree that any dispute between you and us (or other Sweetgreen Parties) relating in any way to the Services or this Agreement, or arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, 47 U.S.C. section 227, or other state or federal law or regulation governing calls or text messages, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you and the Sweetgreen Parties may assert claims in small claims court if the claims qualify; and (2) you or the Sweetgreen Parties may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). <strong>This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</strong></p><p>16.2 <u><strong>Arbitration Rules and Forum.</strong></u> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Sweetgreen, 3101 West Exposition Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90018, Attn: Support. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims with an amount in controversy under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’ most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ </a>; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>. JAMS’s rules are also available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and you cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Sweetgreen will pay them for you.</p><p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the U.S. county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>16.3 <u><strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong></u> Without limiting the scope of Section 16.1, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Sweetgreen Parties. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual party under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p><p>16.4 <u><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong></u> YOU AND the Sweetgreen parties HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PERMITTED HEREIN) AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and the Sweetgreen Parties are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 17.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p>16.5 <u><strong>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong></u> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE FOR CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF OR AGAINST ANY OTHER USER OR PERSON. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this Section 16.5’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the applicable claim, and only that applicable claim, must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the state or federal courts located in California in accordance with Section 17.4. All other claims shall be arbitrated.</p><p>16.6 <u><strong>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</strong></u> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Sweetgreen, 3101 West Exposition Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90018, Attn: Support or email to privacy@sweetgreen.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have with us, or may enter into in the future with us or other Sweetgreen Parties.</p><p>16.7 <u><strong>Severability.</strong></u> Except as provided in Section 17.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p><p>16.8 <u><strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong></u> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement or your relationship with Sweetgreen.</p><p>16.9 <u><strong>Modification.</strong></u> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Sweetgreen makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Sweetgreen at the following address: Sweetgreen, 3101 West Exposition Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90018, Attn: Support.</p><p><strong>17.
